The purposes of this Act are to—
(1) improve the effectiveness and performance of Federal
financial assistance programs;
(2) simplify Federal financial assistance application and
reporting requirements;
(3) improve the delivery of services to the public; and (4) facilitate greater coordination among those responsible
for delivering such services.
